                    <p>Divorce is the process wherein a marital union is legally terminated. It is more permanent in comparison to informal separations and officializes the end of the marriage.
                       This process can be complex, as many legal, financial, and custodial proceedings may be involved. Divorce can happen due to many different reasons,
                       such as infidelity, abuse, financial struggles, or even just falling out of love for one another due to
                       unfixable differences. Out of all the countries in the world, the Philippines is among the only 2 countries without an act
                       legalizing divorce (along with Vatican City). This website aims to defend the legalization of divorce and state why it is healthy for the 
                       Filipino people.

                <h3><u><b>Relevance to SDGs</b></u></h3>
                <div class="image-text-container">
                    <img src="images/RELEVANCE TO SDGâ€™S.png" alt="Placeholder image">
                    <p>This matter correlates to the <b> SDGs 3 (Good Health & Well-Being), 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities),
                        10 (Reduced Inequalities), 4 (Quality Education), and 5 (Gender Equality)</b> the most. Divorce is relevant to SDG #3 as many Filipinos, especially women, suffer from
                        domestic abuse. It also contributes to SDG #16 as the ability to get out of a relationship that one is unhappy with can foster peace in their lives, and those mistreated
                        attain freedom and have the chance to get the justice they deserve. Divorce can also add up to a more cohesive community (SDG #10) as it can help address social issues within families.
                        It also entails gender equality (SDG #5) as it helps ensure that all genders have equal rights and opportunities within themselves and their families. Divorce can lead to good health & well-being (SDG #3) as it can help relieve an individual
                        from the mental trauma they experienced in a relationship. It can also affect financial stability and be more inclusive towards the middle to lower class because most Filipinos are not financially able enough to afford nullifying their marriages.
                        Lastly it also contributes to Quality Education (SDG 4) as situationally, divorce can contribute to the improvement of the quality education access a child has.

                    <p>
                        The importance of divorce does not lie on whether or not you would want a divorce. It lies on the empathy and support towards those who do for valid reasons.
                        Divorce can promote formal separation that can free both individuals of legal hindrances, allowing them to improve their well-being and mental health after the draining relationship.
                        It can also foster an emphasis on the legal rights of a person to property division, child custody, and the legal right to <b>end a marriage.</b> 
                        Divorce aids in bringing social justice to those who experienced oppression, be it physically, emotionally, mentally, or spiritually, and be free of the negative situations and live a better, more fulfilling life.
