        <p>The importance of divorce does not lie on whether or not you would want a divorce. It lies on the empathy and support towards those who do for valid reasons.
            Divorce can promote formal separation that can free both individuals of legal hindrances, allowing them to improve their well-being and mental health after the draining relationship.
            It can also foster an emphasis on the legal rights of a person to property division, child custody, and the legal right to <b>end a marriage.</b> Divorce aids in bringing social justice to those who experienced oppression, be it physically, emotionally, mentally, or spiritually,
            and be free of the negative situations and live a better, more fulfilling life.

            <h3>Violence Against Women</h3>
                   <img src="images/pcw.png" alt="Placeholder image">
                   <p>VAW is often caused by the belief that men are more powerful than women. This idea comes from old-fashioned ways of thinking about gender roles. Men are usually seen as the leaders and providers, while women are seen as caregivers and supporters. This imbalance of power can lead to violence against women as a way for men to control them.
